# gsk-jll-development
JLL Market App extension for the GSK account. It maps the names of displayed fields to be more user friendly.

The JLL Market App is built on a standard CoStar transaction management SaaS software. As such, the fields and templates that can be customised are very limited.

The objective of this app is to enable users to customise the Market app environement so that it is easier to use. For example, this extension will change the wording 'User Defined Field' to 'NPV' or whatever is preferred by the user.

This functionality is enabled by browser extensions that are client-side scripts.
